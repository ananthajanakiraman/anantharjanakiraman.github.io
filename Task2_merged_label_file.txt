upservice was a little slowtake out from this placemy two centsmany times in the pasti would have given themgotten take outgave this place a tryfor startersas soon as we walked ina bottle of sakeowned and operatedvery well preparedsaid she wouldpeople are very niceno vegetables ormy gotoin old townfor lunch yesterdayat taoa few years agodelivered to my housesuck it upon a

interesting menuan extra sidealmost every timefor two peopleyou get a lot ofi would recommend this placean hour and a halfset it downlow and beholdslices of beefcuts of beefborn and raised inrecommend it highlywe found ourselvesup to dateservice was spot onneither one of usif we were ready to orderi usually do take outi don't want tofloor to ceilinghole in the wall chinese placeasked if i could haveyou will noticeyou can choose fromseveral times a weekover a certain amountthis is our go tolived in chinavariety of vegetablestender pieces ofat a great priceall

muchto try this place outthere are a fewonly complaint is thatnot a big fan ofat a reasonable priceare to die forwait for a tabletough to chewget what you pay forlooked like they werewatching a movielady behind the counterwe were the only ones therethis is my go to chinesemake you feel likein a to go containeri've had a lot ofhad take out from herewish i could saythey make their noodlestheir soups areso grossed outplus they deliveron vacationhave found so farhas been consistently goodever eat here againwilling to givewhen we arrivedthose of you whoglad we didnumber of tablesmeant to bewe were seated quicklytheir own noodlesyour mouthyou probably won'tyou know what to orderyou feel at homeyou come to expectwould eat there againwith your choice of soupwith a group of friendswill never go herewhen you first walk inwhen we got therewhat i would expectwe will be back for surewe were on our waywe went for dinnerwe ordered a ton ofwas very apologeticwas no exceptionwant to like this placetook care of usthis place was recommendedthis place reminds me ofthis place has been here forthey no longer havethey messed up my orderthey give you a ton ofthere are a lot oftell you howsorry to saysomething a little moreso many differentso glad we didone of my favorite places toon weekdaysnothing to do withnot as spicy asmy favorite place to getmy colleaguemight be a littleit took a while foris one of the best placesin one sittingif you are hungryi wouldn't order it againi would not come backi highly recommend you tryi have to tell youi have ever eateni have been eating here sincei have been coming herei gave it starsi didn't pay fori didn't even get toi didn't even geti couldn't quitehad a chance to trygo out of your way togiven up onfrom what i hearfor about years now andfor a quick mealfor a quick dinnerfor a couple of yearsdo not want tocould have had morecould have been morebut i think i'llbill was underbest chinese food in vegasat an asian restaurantask them to make itanything wrong witham not a big fan ofabout as good as it getsa side of white ricea little heavy ona certain waya bunch of stuffpeople who wantour last visitrestaurant is very clean andsome of their othermy only complaint is thati have never had amoved to phoenixunder a heat lampservice was very attentiveplace was nearly emptylocated in a smallfood is always consistentsince we were stayingmy in lawsi have never seenhave gotten take outfor what you pay fordecided to check it outat the top of my listand i can see whywill not be able toyou may askwould have takenthey charged meover a year agolast time we wentget my money backbefore we got ourrun a businessfrom time to timearound the corner fromdecided to stop byquite a fewnot a huge fan ofwanted to try something newnever had it beforeyou need to knowyou can get a freewith chinese herbswill cost youwhen it first openedwe will go backwe settled onwe got take out fromwe found this placewe decided to givewant to come backvery sweet and attentivetoo thick for myto top it all offthis restaurant does notthis place is very cleanthis place is not for youthis is going to be athey will make itthey treat theirthey are always fastthere is no wayso you can watchsince it openedsee for yourselfput in front ofour trip to vegason a side notenot in a hurrynot easy to findnot busy at allmy only regret ismy favorite place to eatmore interested inmade with white meatmade a mistakelooking for some good chineselike some places dojust be carefulis not much to look atis as authentic as it getsin this part of townin need of someif you just wantif you feel likeif you are looking for somethingi would never go backi would go back againi wish i could give thisi will go backi will be backi have no ideai have been going herei did not enjoyi can see howhave to go back tohave ordered from themhave a hankering for chinesego there anymorego out of their way toget tired offuss is aboutfor a quick luncheverytime i comedoes it rightdo a good jobcomes to mindby far the best chinese foodbut nothing to rave aboutbut i won't bebut i digressbest thing about this place isbest chinese in phoenixbecause there was so muchbe a regular hereany type ofand they will cookalways fast and friendlyalways a great experienceall i know is thata whole bunch ofa little more expensivea little lessa little bit of everythinga great mix ofa few other disheseven gave usan hour afterasked if i wanted toi would have likedstaff is always niceservice was on pointservice is always excellentegg and tomatobowls of ricetrying to figure outtake out containerone of my dining companionsoh so tastyneither of us couldmy brother in lawwhile you waitbefore they closedjust the right amount of heatyou can affordnot overly spicyfrom my officecould not understandcourteous and helpfulcuts of chickensmall piece ofparty of fourin the mood for chinesein front of meyou
